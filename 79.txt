Algorithm:
    For each three-digit sequence jkl,
        If there's no path from j to k or k to l,
            Draw such a directed edge from j to k or k to l
        If there's more than one path from any m to n
            Remove all paths except for the longest
    The result should be a linear acyclic chain
